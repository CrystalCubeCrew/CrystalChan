# CrystalChan

Crystal-Chan is the Avatar that the user will see on the front end. It will be designed and animated using Blender and any audio sound effect for the avatar to use will be created and/or edited using Audacity. Crystal-Chan will grab response information from the CrystalCube itself. The response information will be strings of text that tell the Crystal-Chan component what animation to play. Crystal-Chan will play the animation that it was told to play as the CrystalCube itself played the audio response through its speakers.
Methodical commands are processed with Crystal-Chan through the Unity3D environment. These commands include playing a particular animation. Methods for playing a particular animation will be coded using C#. The CrystalCube will send a request to the method for playing an animation. This would be a method call with a string passed as a parameter stating which animation to play. With this information  the method will determine which animation should be played and call another method to play that animation. Crystal-Chan’s animation will then be displayed on the LCD screen on the CrystalCube and the reflective glass will show the animation in a holographic way.
